# Todo CLI App

## Notes:
- `__main__.py`: Provides an entry-point script to run the app from the package using the python -m rptodo command
- Adding a descriptive and detailed README.md file to your project is a best practice in programming, especially if you plan to release the project as open source.
- To run the version: `python -m todo_cli -v`
- To run the tests: `pytest tests/`
