Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also know as "lightweight process")
A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All thread within a process share the same memory
+ lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O bound tasks

- Threading is limited by GIL: only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU bound tasks
- Not interuptable
- Careful with race conditions
