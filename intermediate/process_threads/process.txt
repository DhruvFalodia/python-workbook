Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space
+ Great for CPU bound processing
+ New process is started independently from other processes
+ Processes are interuptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- Inter process communication is more complicated
