## [5 Powerful Python One-Liners You Should Know](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/5-powerful-python-one-liners-you-should-know-469b9c4737c7) <span id="content-1"></span>

### 1- Typecasting of all items in a list
- Example 1:
  ```python
  >>> list(map(int, ['1', '2', '3']))

  # Output
  [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- Example 2:
  ```python
  >>> list(map(float, ['1', 2, '3.0', 4.0, '5', 6]))

  # Output
  [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
  ```

### 2- Sum of digits of an integer
- This example is a bit weird!
- Example:
  ```python
  sum_of_digits = lambda x: sum(map(int, str(x)))
  print(sum_of_digits(1789))

  # Output
  25
  ```

### 3- Flat a list that contains sublists
- The old way:
  ```python
  flattened_list = []
  for sublist in l:
      for item in sublist:
          flattened_list.append(item)
  ```
- The one-liner:
  ```python
  >>> l = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], [7, 8], [9]]
  >>> flattened_list = [item for sublist in l for item in sublist]
  >>> print(flattened_list)

  # Output
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  ```

### 4- Transpose of a Matrix
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
  >>> transpose_A = [list(i) for i in zip(*A)]
  ```


### 5- Swap keys and values in a dictionary
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> staff = {'Data Scientist': 'John', 'Django Developer': 'Jane'}
  >>> staff = {i:j for j, i in staff.items()}
  ```

## [11 Python Tricks to Boost Your Python Skills Significantly](https://python.plainenglish.io/11-python-tricks-to-boost-your-python-skills-significantly-1a5221dfa5c7) <span id="content-2"></span>

### 1- Remove repeated items from a list
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
  >>> print(list(set(numbers)))
  ```

### 2- Zip Your Data
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> names = list(zip((1, 2), ['Anna', 'Alice']))
  >>> print(names)
  ```

### 3- Reverse Lists
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  >>> print(numbers[::-1])
  ```

### 4- Count all occurrences
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> from collections import Counter
  >>> numbers = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 3, 6]
  >>> c = Counter(numbers)
  >>> print(c)

  # Output, returned a Counter object
  Counter({1: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1, 6: 1})
  ```

### 5- Check Your Python Version
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> import sys
  >>> print(sys.version_info)

  sys.version_info(major=3, minor=7, micro=4, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
  ```

### 6- Print your data with separators:
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> username = "user"
  >>> host = "mail.com"
  >>> print(username, host,sep="@")

  # Output
  user@mail.com
  ```

### 7- Swap dictionary key & values:
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> mydict= {1: 11, 2: 22, 3: 33}
  >>> mydict = {i: j for j, i in mydict.items()}
  >>> print(mydict)

  # Output
  {11: 1, 22: 2, 33: 3}
  ```

### 8- Get indexes of all letters from a string
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> s = ‚ÄùPython‚Äù
  >>> e = enumerate(s)
  >>> print(list(e))

  # Output
  [(0, 'P'), (1, 'y'), (2, 't'), (3, 'h'), (4, 'o'), (5, 'n')]
  ```

### 9- Check if objects are the same with is & not is
- To check if two things refer to the same thing, use `is` operator
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> t1 = ["Africa"]
  >>> t2 = ["Africa"]
  >>> t3 = t2
  >>> print(t1 is t2)
  >>> print(t1 is t3)
  >>> print(t1 is not t2)

  # Output
  False
  False
  True
  ```

### 10- Concatenate tuples
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> colors = ('blue', 'red') + ('yellow', 'green')
  >>> print(colors)

  # Output
  ('blue', 'red', 'yellow', 'green')
  ```

### 11- Use return instead of return None
- In Python, if return value of a function is not specified, the function returns None by default.
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> def double(n):
  ...     print(n * 2)
  >>> double(5)
  >>> print(type(double(5)))
  ```

## [3 Useful Python f-string Tricks You Probably Don‚Äôt Know](https://betterprogramming.pub/3-useful-python-f-string-tricks-you-probably-dont-know-f908f7ed6cf5) <span id="content-3"></span>

### Introduction
- How we do it the old way and new way:
  ![How we do it the old way and new way](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*kkgkA8RkrR2PzuvoDYC7pw.png)
- Simply prefix your string with an f or F and then followed by single, double, or even triple quotes to create your string, e.g., f"Hello, Python!".


### 1. F-string for Debugging
- Simple huh?
  ```python
  viewer = "üêä"
  owner = "üêº"
  editor = "üêì"

  print(viewer)
  print(owner)
  print(editor)
  ```
- Sometimes we are confused about which variable is printed. This how we can improve debugging process:
  ```python
  print(f"{viewer=}")
  print(f"{owner=}")
  print(f"{editor=}")

  # Stdout:

  # viewer = "üêä"
  # owner = "üêº"
  # editor = "üêì"
  ```
- Furthermore, using f-string this way preserves whitespaces, which can be helpful during our debugging process when we are in the midst of looking at confusing terminal logs.
  ```python
  print(f"{viewer=     }")
  print(f"{owner     =}")
  print(f"{editor     =      }")

  # Stdout:

  # viewer=     'üêä'
  # owner     ='üêº'
  # editor     =      'üêì'
  ```

### 2. String Formatting
- How to format float:
  ```python
  # The "old" ways of updating float to 2 decimal places
  float_variable = 3.141592653589793

  print("%.2f" % float_variable)
  print("{:.2f}".format(float_variable))

  # Stdout:

  # 3.14
  # 3.14

  # The new way with f-string
  float_variable = 3.141592653589793

  print(f"{float_variable:.2f}")

  # Stdout:
  # 3.14
  ```
- Formatting currency:
  ```python
  money = 3_142_671.76 # üí° This is the same as 3142671.76

  print(f"${money:,.2f}")

  # Stdout:
  # $3,142,671.76
  ```
- Formatting datetime:
  ```python
  from datetime import datetime


  now = datetime.now()

  # The usual way
  formatted_datetime_now = now.strftime('%d-%B-%Y')
  print(formatted_datetime_now)

  # F-string way
  formatted_datetime_now = f"{now:%d-%B-%Y}"
  print(formatted_datetime_now)

  # Stdout
  # 05-July-2021
  ```
- Padding your int variables with leading zeroes or whitespaces
  ```python
  # Output length of 20, and pad the rest with zeroes

  int_variable = 1_234_567
  print(f'{int_variable:020}')

  # Stdout
  # 00000000000001234567


  # Output length of 24, and pad the rest with zeroes
  int_variable = 30
  print(f'{int_variable:024}')

  # Stdout
  # 000000000000000000000030
  ```
  ```python
  # Output length of 10, and pad the rest with leading whitesplace
  int_variable = 20_21
  print(f'{int_variable:10d}')

  # Stdout
  # '      2021'


  # Output length of 5, and pad the rest with leading whitesplace
  print(f"{int_variable:5d}")

  # Stdout
  # ' 2021'
  ```


### Conversion
- Convert your string to ASCII representation
  ```python
  owl = 'ü¶â'
  print(f'{owl!a}')

  # Stdout
  # '\U0001f989'
  ```
- A repr() alternative with f-string
  ```python
  from datetime import datetime


  now = datetime.now()

  # Using repr()
  print(repr(now))


  # F-string way
  print(f'{now!r}')

  # Stdout
  # datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 5, 13, 2, 34, 672383)

  repr(now) == f'{now!r}'
  # True
  ```

## [10 Advanced Python Tricks To Write Faster, Cleaner Code](https://medium.com/pythonland/10-advanced-python-tricks-to-write-faster-cleaner-code-f9ee76fa878f) <span id="content-4"></span>

### 1. Using slotted classes
- In a slotted class we explicitly define the fields that our class is allowed to have using the magic field name __slots__.
- Advantages:
  - Objects created from the class will take up slightly less memory
  - It‚Äôs faster to access class attributes
  - You can‚Äôt randomly add new attributes to objects of a slotted class
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> class Card:
  ...     __slots__ = 'rank', 'suite'
  ...     def __init__(self, rank, suite):
  ...             self.rank = rank
  ...             self.suite = suite
  ... 
  >>> qh = Card('queen', 'hearts')
  ```
- You can't create some random new attributes, certainly good to prevent errors.


### 2. Get the size of an object
- With sys.getsizeof() you can check the memory usage of a Python object.
- Example:
  ```python
  import sys

  mylist = range(0, 10000)
  print(sys.getsizeof(mylist))
  # 48
  ```
- A range, which is a generator object, is much more memory efficient than using an actual list of numbers. It generates a new number if requested, instead of actually storing all the numbers.
- Unfortunately, sys.getsizeof() only works well for built-in data types. For custom data types and more profiling tools, you should check out a package called Pympler, which offers a function called asizeof() .


### 3. Using tuples instead of lists
- A Python tuple is one of Python‚Äôs three built-in sequence data types, the others being lists and range objects.
- A Python tuple shares many properties with a list:
  - It can hold multiple values in a single variable
  - It‚Äôs ordered: the order of items is preserved
  - A tuple can have duplicate values
  - It‚Äôs indexed: you can access items numerically
  - A tuple can have an arbitrary length
- There are differences though:
  - A tuple is immutable; it can not be changed once you defined it.
  - A tuple is defined using optional parentheses () instead of square brackets []
  - Because tuples are immutable, and thus hashable, they can act as the key in a dictionary
- If you don‚Äôt need to modify your list, consider a tuple.


### 4. Conditional statements (Inline if/else)
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> def get_status(error):
  ...     return 'OK' if not error else 'We have a problem'
  ...
  >>> get_status(error=True)
  'We have a problem'
  >>> get_status(error=False)
  'OK'
  ```

### 5. Else statements and loops
- Syntax:
  ```python
  # for loop
  for x in <some iterable>:
      ...
  else:
      ....

  # while loop
  while <some condition>:
      ...
  else:
      ...
  ```
- The else part is executed by default (when the iterable is exhausted) unless the loop is ‚Äòbroken‚Äô with a break statement.

### 6. Sorting Objects by Multiple Keys
- Example:
  ```python
  import operator

  people.sort(key=operator.itemgetter('age'))
  people.sort(key=operator.itemgetter('name'))
  ```
- We first sort by age, and then by name. With operator.itemgetter() we get the age and name fields from each dictionary inside the list in a concise way.

### 7. Comprehensions
- Basic syntax:
  ```python
  [ expression for item in list if conditional ]
  ```
- Example:
  ```python
  mylist = [i for i in range(10)]
  print(mylist)
  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
  print(squares)
  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

  def some_function(a):
    return (a + 5) / 2
  my_formula = [some_function(i) for i in range(10)]
  print(my_formula)
  # [2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0]

  filtered = [i for i in range(20) if i%2==0]
  print(filtered)
  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
  ```


### 8. Data classes
- There are several advantages over regular classes or other alternatives like returning multiple values or dictionaries:
  - a data class requires a minimal amount of code
  - you can compare data classes because __eq__ is implemented for you
  - you can easily print a data class for debugging because __repr__ is implemented as well
  - data classes require type hints, reducing the chances of bugs
- Example:
  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class Card:
      rank: str
      suit: str
      
  card = Card("Q", "hearts")

  print(card == card)
  # True

  print(card.rank)
  # 'Q'

  print(card)
  Card(rank='Q', suit='hearts')
  ```
- You can combine the slotted classes technique from #1 with data classes to create a data class with a fixed set of fields.


### 9. Merging dictionaries
- Example:
  ```python
  dict1 = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
  dict2 = { 'b': 3, 'c': 4 }
  merged = { **dict1, **dict2 }

  print (merged)
  # {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}

  # Python >= 3.9 only
  merged = dict1 | dict2

  print (merged)
  # {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
  ```

### 10. Using and knowing itertools
- Itertools is a built-in library that offers a number of iterator building blocks.
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> # Calculate all profucs of an input
  >>> list(itertools.product('abc', repeat=2))
  [('a', 'a'), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), 
   ('b', 'a'), ('b', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), 
   ('c', 'a'), ('c', 'b'), ('c', 'c')]
   
  >>> # Calculate all permutations
  >>> list(itertools.permutations('abc'))
  [('a', 'b', 'c'), ('a', 'c', 'b'), ('b', 'a', 'c'), 
   ('b', 'c', 'a'), ('c', 'a', 'b'), ('c', 'b', 'a')]

  >>> # Take elements for iterator as long as predicate is True
  >>> list(itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x<5, [1,4,6,4,1]))
  [1, 4]
  ```

## [Python tricks I wish I knew earlier](https://preettheman.medium.com/python-tricks-i-wish-i-knew-earlier-aab07dec3bd4) <span id="content-5"></span>

### Getting Random Data
- Example:
  ```python
  set1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  random.sample(set1, 2)
  ```

### Changing Your While Loops
- Example:
  ```python
  # First
  while True:
    #code down here
  
  # Second
  while 1:
    #code down here
  ```

### Exchanging Variables
- Example:
  ```python
  set1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]set2 = [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
  set1, set2 = set2, set1
  ```

### Loading Packages As You Need Them
- This is self explanatory

### Updating Python
- Using the latest version would certainly help to speed our code

## [32 Advanced Techniques for Better Python Code](https://betterprogramming.pub/thirty-two-advanced-techniques-for-better-python-code-6717226eb611) <span id="content-6"></span>

### Documentation techniques
- Technique #1: Create a new version, and document major changes
  - Create a new version, a+1.0.0, if there are a significant amount of architectural changes, a significant amount of code changed, and/or a significant amount of new behavior added.
  - Create a new subversion, a.b+1.0, if there are minor architectural changes, a minor amount of code changed, and/or a minor amount of new behavior added.
  - Create a new sub-subversion, a.b.c+1, if adding a minor amount of code and/or there are bug fixes.
- Technique #2: Document locally any significant addition or change in code
  ```python
  class Scorer(object):
      """
      Transforms a string literal into a callable instance of a
      particular metric
      BHC 1.1.0 - support cluster scoring by add clustering 
      scores and type
              - added METRIC_METADATA dictionary
              - added ML_TYPES = ["Classification", "Regression",
                                  "Clustering"]
              - added METRIC_<>ID Postion index of metric 
                metadata list
              - added SCORE_TYPES
              - added SCORE_SIGN
      """
  ```
- Technique #3: Create long and descriptive names for constants, variables, functions, and class methods
- Technique #4: Transform behaviorally inappropriate comments into behaviorally correct comments to lower maintenance cost and bug generation
- Technique #5: Add comments to increase the readability of code
  - Comment before:
    ```python
    @staticmethod
    def get_json(photon_package):
      """
      Load JSON file in which the elements for the PHOTON submodule are stored.
      The JSON files are stored in the framework folder by the name convention 'photon_package.json'
      Parameters:
      -----------
      * 'photon_package' [str]:
        The name of the photonai submodule
      Returns:
      --------
      JSON file as dict, file path as str
      """
      ```
    - Comment after:
    ```python
    @staticmethod
    def load_json(photon_package: str) -> Any:
        """
        load_json Loads JSON file.
    The class init PipelineElement('name',...)
        stores the element metadata in a json file.
    The JSON files are stored in the framework folder
        by the name convention 'photon_<package>.json'.
        (example:$HOME/PROJECTS/photon/photonai/base/registry/PhotonCore.json)
    The file is of format
        { name-1: ['import-pkg-class-path-1', class-path-1)],
          name-2: ['import-pkg-class-path-2', class-path-2)],
         ....}
    Parameters
        ----------
            photon_package:  The name of the photonai package of element metadata
        Returns
        -------
            [file_content, file_name]
        Notes
        -------
        if  JSON file does not exist, then create blank one.
    """
    ```
- Technique #6: Choose a docstring style, and use it consistently throughout the project (package, library, ‚Ä¶). We use NumPy Style because it is suited for the detailed documentation of classes, methods, functions, and parameters.
  - Corrected code with comment:
    ```python
    @staticmethod
    def get_json(photon_package: str) -> Any:
        """
        get_json Loads JSON file.
    The class init PipelineElement('name',...)
        stores the element metadata in a json file.
    The JSON files are stored in the framework folder
        by the name convention 'photon_<package>.json'.
        (example:$HOME/PROJECTS/photon/photonai/base/registry/PhotonCore.json)
    The file is of format
        { name-1: ['import-pkg-class-path-1', class-path-1)],
          name-2: ['import-pkg-class-path-2', class-path-2)],
         ....}
    Parameters
        ----------
        photon_package:  The name of the photonai package
        of element metadata.
    Returns
        -------
        [file_content, file_name]
    Notes
        -------
        If  JSON file does not exist, then create a blank one.
        """
    ```
- Technique #7: Apply PEP-8 naming conventions
  - Example:
    ```text
    Globals:
    ELEMENT_TYPE -> ML_TYPE
    ELEMENT_DICTIONARY   ->  METRIC_METADATA
    variables:
    machine_learning_type -> element_type
    ```
- Technique #8: Add type hinting to every function or class method.
  - Type hints (note: not strong type checking) make it possible to accomplish bug hunting, finding security holes, and static type checking after the first pass of coding and unit testing.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def is_machine_learning_type(ml_type: str) -> bool:
    ```
- Technique #9: Transform irrelevant comments to relevant comments
  - Example:
    ```python
    # Original
    # register new object
    PhotonRegister.save("ABC1", "namespace.filename.ABC1", "Transformer")
    
    # After
    # register new element
    PhotonRegister.register("ABC1", "namespace.filename.ABC1", "Transformer")
    ```
- Technique #10: Keep only architectural #todo comments
- Technique #11: Delete old code that is commented out.
  - Before:
    ```python
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.custom_elements_folder:
            self._load_custom_folder(self.custom_elements_folder)
    # base_PHOTON_REGISTRIES = ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
    # PHOTON_REGISTRIES = ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
    # def __init__(self, custom_elements_folder: str = None):
    #     if custom_elements_folder:
    #         self._load_custom_folder()
    #     else:
    #         self.custom_elements = None
    #         self.custom_elements_folder = None
    #         self.custom_elements_file = None`
    ```
  - Before:
    ```python
    def __post_init__(self):
      if self.custom_elements_folder:
          self._load_custom_folder(self.custom_elements_folder)
    ```
  - Lines-of-code (LOC) complexity is reduced by elimination of commented-out old code.
  
### Coding Techniques
- Technique #12: Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel
  - Before you write a line of code for your idea or task, search for solutions that others have coded.
- Technique #13: Learn from others‚Äô code.
- Technique #14: Log; don‚Äôt print
- Technique #15: Do not code global data structures; use parameter files
- Technique #16: Create a function or method to encapsulate value checking
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def is_machine_learning_type(ml_type: str) -> bool:
      """
      :raises
      if not known machine_learning_type
  :param machine_learning_type
      :return: True
      """
      if ml_type in Scorer.ML_TYPES:
          return True
      else:
          logger.error(
              "Specify valid ml_type to choose best config: {}".format(ml_type)

- Technique #17: Create the package error type
- Technique #18: Create a raise function with the package error type
  ```python
  import logging
  class PhotoaiError(Exception):
      pass
  def raise_PhotoaiError(msg):
      logger.error(msg)
      raise PhotoaiError(msg)
  
  @staticmethod
  def is_machine_learning_type(ml_type: str) -> bool:
      """
      Parameters:
      -----------
      machine_learning_type
  Returns
     -----------
     True
  Raises
     -----------
     if not known machine_learning_type
     """
     if ml_type in Scorer.ML_TYPES:
          return True
  raise_PhotoaiError(
          "Specify valid ml_type:{} of [{}]".format(ml_type,
          Scorer.ML_TYPES))
  ```
- Technique #19: Use faulthandler
- Technique #20: Eliminate global variables ‚Äî or at least try
- Technique #21: Eliminate all unused local variables
  - Usually, your IDE identifies all dangling variables for you. If not, you use locals()and use search.
- Technique #22: Apply the Python 3.7+ @dataclass decorator before the class definition.
  - @dataclass decorates a def class definition and automatically generates the five double dunder methods: `__init__()` ,` __repr__()` , `__str__`,`__eq__()`, and `__hash__()`
  - Example:
    ```python
    @dataclass
    class PhotonRegistry:
        """
        Helper class to manage the PHOTON Element Register
        ...
        """
        custom_elements_folder: str = None
        custom_elements: str = None
        custom_elements_file: str = None
        base_PHOTON_REGISTRIES: ClassVar[List[str]] =/
       ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
        PHOTON_REGISTRIES: ClassVar[List[str]] =/
       ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.custom_elements_folder:
            self._load_custom_folder(self.custom_elements_folder)
    ```

### Testing Techniques
- Technique #24: Unit tests have 80%+ coverage. We use coverage.
- Technique #25: Integration tests must have 100% coverage of all external (API) functions, classes, class attributes, and class methods.
- Technique #26: The developers do not accomplish acceptance testing.
- Technique #27: Code type hinting checking.
- Technique #28: Test coverage
- Technique #29: Performance profiling
- Technique #29:Check security
- Technique #29:Code reliability

### Verification Techniques
- Technique #30: Code review
- Technique #31: Version control
- Technique #32: Continuous integration (CI) automation
