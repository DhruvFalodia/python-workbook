## [5 Powerful Python One-Liners You Should Know](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/5-powerful-python-one-liners-you-should-know-469b9c4737c7) <span id="content-1"></span>

### 1- Typecasting of all items in a list
- Example 1:
  ```python
  >>> list(map(int, ['1', '2', '3']))

  # Output
  [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- Example 2:
  ```python
  >>> list(map(float, ['1', 2, '3.0', 4.0, '5', 6]))

  # Output
  [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
  ```

### 2- Sum of digits of an integer
- This example is a bit weird!
- Example:
  ```python
  sum_of_digits = lambda x: sum(map(int, str(x)))
  print(sum_of_digits(1789))

  # Output
  25
  ```

### 3- Flat a list that contains sublists
- The old way:
  ```python
  flattened_list = []
  for sublist in l:
      for item in sublist:
          flattened_list.append(item)
  ```
- The one-liner:
  ```python
  >>> l = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], [7, 8], [9]]
  >>> flattened_list = [item for sublist in l for item in sublist]
  >>> print(flattened_list)

  # Output
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  ```

### 4- Transpose of a Matrix
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
  >>> transpose_A = [list(i) for i in zip(*A)]
  ```


### 5- Swap keys and values in a dictionary
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> staff = {'Data Scientist': 'John', 'Django Developer': 'Jane'}
  >>> staff = {i:j for j, i in staff.items()}
  ```

## [11 Python Tricks to Boost Your Python Skills Significantly](https://python.plainenglish.io/11-python-tricks-to-boost-your-python-skills-significantly-1a5221dfa5c7) <span id="content-2"></span>

### 1- Remove repeated items from a list
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
  >>> print(list(set(numbers)))
  ```

### 2- Zip Your Data
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> names = list(zip((1, 2), ['Anna', 'Alice']))
  >>> print(names)
  ```

### 3- Reverse Lists
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  >>> print(numbers[::-1])
  ```

### 4- Count all occurrences
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> from collections import Counter
  >>> numbers = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 3, 6]
  >>> c = Counter(numbers)
  >>> print(c)

  # Output, returned a Counter object
  Counter({1: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1, 6: 1})
  ```

### 5- Check Your Python Version
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> import sys
  >>> print(sys.version_info)

  sys.version_info(major=3, minor=7, micro=4, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
  ```

### 6- Print your data with separators:
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> username = "user"
  >>> host = "mail.com"
  >>> print(username, host,sep="@")

  # Output
  user@mail.com
  ```

### 7- Swap dictionary key & values:
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> mydict= {1: 11, 2: 22, 3: 33}
  >>> mydict = {i: j for j, i in mydict.items()}
  >>> print(mydict)

  # Output
  {11: 1, 22: 2, 33: 3}
  ```

### 8- Get indexes of all letters from a string
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> s = ‚ÄùPython‚Äù
  >>> e = enumerate(s)
  >>> print(list(e))

  # Output
  [(0, 'P'), (1, 'y'), (2, 't'), (3, 'h'), (4, 'o'), (5, 'n')]
  ```

### 9- Check if objects are the same with is & not is
- To check if two things refer to the same thing, use `is` operator
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> t1 = ["Africa"]
  >>> t2 = ["Africa"]
  >>> t3 = t2
  >>> print(t1 is t2)
  >>> print(t1 is t3)
  >>> print(t1 is not t2)

  # Output
  False
  False
  True
  ```

### 10- Concatenate tuples
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> colors = ('blue', 'red') + ('yellow', 'green')
  >>> print(colors)

  # Output
  ('blue', 'red', 'yellow', 'green')
  ```

### 11- Use return instead of return None
- In Python, if return value of a function is not specified, the function returns None by default.
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> def double(n):
  ...     print(n * 2)
  >>> double(5)
  >>> print(type(double(5)))
  ```

## [3 Useful Python f-string Tricks You Probably Don‚Äôt Know](https://betterprogramming.pub/3-useful-python-f-string-tricks-you-probably-dont-know-f908f7ed6cf5) <span id="content-3"></span>

### Introduction
- How we do it the old way and new way:
  ![How we do it the old way and new way](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*kkgkA8RkrR2PzuvoDYC7pw.png)
- Simply prefix your string with an f or F and then followed by single, double, or even triple quotes to create your string, e.g., f"Hello, Python!".


### 1. F-string for Debugging
- Simple huh?
  ```python
  viewer = "üêä"
  owner = "üêº"
  editor = "üêì"

  print(viewer)
  print(owner)
  print(editor)
  ```
- Sometimes we are confused about which variable is printed. This how we can improve debugging process:
  ```python
  print(f"{viewer=}")
  print(f"{owner=}")
  print(f"{editor=}")

  # Stdout:

  # viewer = "üêä"
  # owner = "üêº"
  # editor = "üêì"
  ```
- Furthermore, using f-string this way preserves whitespaces, which can be helpful during our debugging process when we are in the midst of looking at confusing terminal logs.
  ```python
  print(f"{viewer=     }")
  print(f"{owner     =}")
  print(f"{editor     =      }")

  # Stdout:

  # viewer=     'üêä'
  # owner     ='üêº'
  # editor     =      'üêì'
  ```

### 2. String Formatting
- How to format float:
  ```python
  # The "old" ways of updating float to 2 decimal places
  float_variable = 3.141592653589793

  print("%.2f" % float_variable)
  print("{:.2f}".format(float_variable))

  # Stdout:

  # 3.14
  # 3.14

  # The new way with f-string
  float_variable = 3.141592653589793

  print(f"{float_variable:.2f}")

  # Stdout:
  # 3.14
  ```
- Formatting currency:
  ```python
  money = 3_142_671.76 # üí° This is the same as 3142671.76

  print(f"${money:,.2f}")

  # Stdout:
  # $3,142,671.76
  ```
- Formatting datetime:
  ```python
  from datetime import datetime


  now = datetime.now()

  # The usual way
  formatted_datetime_now = now.strftime('%d-%B-%Y')
  print(formatted_datetime_now)

  # F-string way
  formatted_datetime_now = f"{now:%d-%B-%Y}"
  print(formatted_datetime_now)

  # Stdout
  # 05-July-2021
  ```
- Padding your int variables with leading zeroes or whitespaces
  ```python
  # Output length of 20, and pad the rest with zeroes

  int_variable = 1_234_567
  print(f'{int_variable:020}')

  # Stdout
  # 00000000000001234567


  # Output length of 24, and pad the rest with zeroes
  int_variable = 30
  print(f'{int_variable:024}')

  # Stdout
  # 000000000000000000000030
  ```
  ```python
  # Output length of 10, and pad the rest with leading whitesplace
  int_variable = 20_21
  print(f'{int_variable:10d}')

  # Stdout
  # '      2021'


  # Output length of 5, and pad the rest with leading whitesplace
  print(f"{int_variable:5d}")

  # Stdout
  # ' 2021'
  ```


### Conversion
- Convert your string to ASCII representation
  ```python
  owl = 'ü¶â'
  print(f'{owl!a}')

  # Stdout
  # '\U0001f989'
  ```
- A repr() alternative with f-string
  ```python
  from datetime import datetime


  now = datetime.now()

  # Using repr()
  print(repr(now))


  # F-string way
  print(f'{now!r}')

  # Stdout
  # datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 5, 13, 2, 34, 672383)

  repr(now) == f'{now!r}'
  # True
  ```

## [10 Advanced Python Tricks To Write Faster, Cleaner Code](https://medium.com/pythonland/10-advanced-python-tricks-to-write-faster-cleaner-code-f9ee76fa878f) <span id="content-4"></span>

### 1. Using slotted classes
- In a slotted class we explicitly define the fields that our class is allowed to have using the magic field name __slots__.
- Advantages:
  - Objects created from the class will take up slightly less memory
  - It‚Äôs faster to access class attributes
  - You can‚Äôt randomly add new attributes to objects of a slotted class
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> class Card:
  ...     __slots__ = 'rank', 'suite'
  ...     def __init__(self, rank, suite):
  ...             self.rank = rank
  ...             self.suite = suite
  ... 
  >>> qh = Card('queen', 'hearts')
  ```
- You can't create some random new attributes, certainly good to prevent errors.


### 2. Get the size of an object
- With sys.getsizeof() you can check the memory usage of a Python object.
- Example:
  ```python
  import sys

  mylist = range(0, 10000)
  print(sys.getsizeof(mylist))
  # 48
  ```
- A range, which is a generator object, is much more memory efficient than using an actual list of numbers. It generates a new number if requested, instead of actually storing all the numbers.
- Unfortunately, sys.getsizeof() only works well for built-in data types. For custom data types and more profiling tools, you should check out a package called Pympler, which offers a function called asizeof() .


### 3. Using tuples instead of lists
- A Python tuple is one of Python‚Äôs three built-in sequence data types, the others being lists and range objects.
- A Python tuple shares many properties with a list:
  - It can hold multiple values in a single variable
  - It‚Äôs ordered: the order of items is preserved
  - A tuple can have duplicate values
  - It‚Äôs indexed: you can access items numerically
  - A tuple can have an arbitrary length
- There are differences though:
  - A tuple is immutable; it can not be changed once you defined it.
  - A tuple is defined using optional parentheses () instead of square brackets []
  - Because tuples are immutable, and thus hashable, they can act as the key in a dictionary
- If you don‚Äôt need to modify your list, consider a tuple.


### 4. Conditional statements (Inline if/else)
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> def get_status(error):
  ...     return 'OK' if not error else 'We have a problem'
  ...
  >>> get_status(error=True)
  'We have a problem'
  >>> get_status(error=False)
  'OK'
  ```

### 5. Else statements and loops
- Syntax:
  ```python
  # for loop
  for x in <some iterable>:
      ...
  else:
      ....

  # while loop
  while <some condition>:
      ...
  else:
      ...
  ```
- The else part is executed by default (when the iterable is exhausted) unless the loop is ‚Äòbroken‚Äô with a break statement.

### 6. Sorting Objects by Multiple Keys
- Example:
  ```python
  import operator

  people.sort(key=operator.itemgetter('age'))
  people.sort(key=operator.itemgetter('name'))
  ```
- We first sort by age, and then by name. With operator.itemgetter() we get the age and name fields from each dictionary inside the list in a concise way.

### 7. Comprehensions
- Basic syntax:
  ```python
  [ expression for item in list if conditional ]
  ```
- Example:
  ```python
  mylist = [i for i in range(10)]
  print(mylist)
  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
  print(squares)
  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

  def some_function(a):
    return (a + 5) / 2
  my_formula = [some_function(i) for i in range(10)]
  print(my_formula)
  # [2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0]

  filtered = [i for i in range(20) if i%2==0]
  print(filtered)
  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
  ```


### 8. Data classes
- There are several advantages over regular classes or other alternatives like returning multiple values or dictionaries:
  - a data class requires a minimal amount of code
  - you can compare data classes because __eq__ is implemented for you
  - you can easily print a data class for debugging because __repr__ is implemented as well
  - data classes require type hints, reducing the chances of bugs
- Example:
  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class Card:
      rank: str
      suit: str
      
  card = Card("Q", "hearts")

  print(card == card)
  # True

  print(card.rank)
  # 'Q'

  print(card)
  Card(rank='Q', suit='hearts')
  ```
- You can combine the slotted classes technique from #1 with data classes to create a data class with a fixed set of fields.


### 9. Merging dictionaries
- Example:
  ```python
  dict1 = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
  dict2 = { 'b': 3, 'c': 4 }
  merged = { **dict1, **dict2 }

  print (merged)
  # {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}

  # Python >= 3.9 only
  merged = dict1 | dict2

  print (merged)
  # {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
  ```

### 10. Using and knowing itertools
- Itertools is a built-in library that offers a number of iterator building blocks.
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> # Calculate all profucs of an input
  >>> list(itertools.product('abc', repeat=2))
  [('a', 'a'), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), 
   ('b', 'a'), ('b', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), 
   ('c', 'a'), ('c', 'b'), ('c', 'c')]
   
  >>> # Calculate all permutations
  >>> list(itertools.permutations('abc'))
  [('a', 'b', 'c'), ('a', 'c', 'b'), ('b', 'a', 'c'), 
   ('b', 'c', 'a'), ('c', 'a', 'b'), ('c', 'b', 'a')]

  >>> # Take elements for iterator as long as predicate is True
  >>> list(itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x<5, [1,4,6,4,1]))
  [1, 4]
  ```

## [Python tricks I wish I knew earlier](https://preettheman.medium.com/python-tricks-i-wish-i-knew-earlier-aab07dec3bd4) <span id="content-5"></span>

### Getting Random Data
- Example:
  ```python
  set1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  random.sample(set1, 2)
  ```

### Changing Your While Loops
- Example:
  ```python
  # First
  while True:
    #code down here
  
  # Second
  while 1:
    #code down here
  ```

### Exchanging Variables
- Example:
  ```python
  set1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]set2 = [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
  set1, set2 = set2, set1
  ```

### Loading Packages As You Need Them
- This is self explanatory

### Updating Python
- Using the latest version would certainly help to speed our code

## [32 Advanced Techniques for Better Python Code](https://betterprogramming.pub/thirty-two-advanced-techniques-for-better-python-code-6717226eb611) <span id="content-6"></span>

### Documentation techniques
- Technique #1: Create a new version, and document major changes
  - Create a new version, a+1.0.0, if there are a significant amount of architectural changes, a significant amount of code changed, and/or a significant amount of new behavior added.
  - Create a new subversion, a.b+1.0, if there are minor architectural changes, a minor amount of code changed, and/or a minor amount of new behavior added.
  - Create a new sub-subversion, a.b.c+1, if adding a minor amount of code and/or there are bug fixes.
- Technique #2: Document locally any significant addition or change in code
  ```python
  class Scorer(object):
      """
      Transforms a string literal into a callable instance of a
      particular metric
      BHC 1.1.0 - support cluster scoring by add clustering 
      scores and type
              - added METRIC_METADATA dictionary
              - added ML_TYPES = ["Classification", "Regression",
                                  "Clustering"]
              - added METRIC_<>ID Postion index of metric 
                metadata list
              - added SCORE_TYPES
              - added SCORE_SIGN
      """
  ```
- Technique #3: Create long and descriptive names for constants, variables, functions, and class methods
- Technique #4: Transform behaviorally inappropriate comments into behaviorally correct comments to lower maintenance cost and bug generation
- Technique #5: Add comments to increase the readability of code
  - Comment before:
    ```python
    @staticmethod
    def get_json(photon_package):
      """
      Load JSON file in which the elements for the PHOTON submodule are stored.
      The JSON files are stored in the framework folder by the name convention 'photon_package.json'
      Parameters:
      -----------
      * 'photon_package' [str]:
        The name of the photonai submodule
      Returns:
      --------
      JSON file as dict, file path as str
      """
      ```
    - Comment after:
    ```python
    @staticmethod
    def load_json(photon_package: str) -> Any:
        """
        load_json Loads JSON file.
    The class init PipelineElement('name',...)
        stores the element metadata in a json file.
    The JSON files are stored in the framework folder
        by the name convention 'photon_<package>.json'.
        (example:$HOME/PROJECTS/photon/photonai/base/registry/PhotonCore.json)
    The file is of format
        { name-1: ['import-pkg-class-path-1', class-path-1)],
          name-2: ['import-pkg-class-path-2', class-path-2)],
         ....}
    Parameters
        ----------
            photon_package:  The name of the photonai package of element metadata
        Returns
        -------
            [file_content, file_name]
        Notes
        -------
        if  JSON file does not exist, then create blank one.
    """
    ```
- Technique #6: Choose a docstring style, and use it consistently throughout the project (package, library, ‚Ä¶). We use NumPy Style because it is suited for the detailed documentation of classes, methods, functions, and parameters.
  - Corrected code with comment:
    ```python
    @staticmethod
    def get_json(photon_package: str) -> Any:
        """
        get_json Loads JSON file.
    The class init PipelineElement('name',...)
        stores the element metadata in a json file.
    The JSON files are stored in the framework folder
        by the name convention 'photon_<package>.json'.
        (example:$HOME/PROJECTS/photon/photonai/base/registry/PhotonCore.json)
    The file is of format
        { name-1: ['import-pkg-class-path-1', class-path-1)],
          name-2: ['import-pkg-class-path-2', class-path-2)],
         ....}
    Parameters
        ----------
        photon_package:  The name of the photonai package
        of element metadata.
    Returns
        -------
        [file_content, file_name]
    Notes
        -------
        If  JSON file does not exist, then create a blank one.
        """
    ```
- Technique #7: Apply PEP-8 naming conventions
  - Example:
    ```text
    Globals:
    ELEMENT_TYPE -> ML_TYPE
    ELEMENT_DICTIONARY   ->  METRIC_METADATA
    variables:
    machine_learning_type -> element_type
    ```
- Technique #8: Add type hinting to every function or class method.
  - Type hints (note: not strong type checking) make it possible to accomplish bug hunting, finding security holes, and static type checking after the first pass of coding and unit testing.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def is_machine_learning_type(ml_type: str) -> bool:
    ```
- Technique #9: Transform irrelevant comments to relevant comments
  - Example:
    ```python
    # Original
    # register new object
    PhotonRegister.save("ABC1", "namespace.filename.ABC1", "Transformer")
    
    # After
    # register new element
    PhotonRegister.register("ABC1", "namespace.filename.ABC1", "Transformer")
    ```
- Technique #10: Keep only architectural #todo comments
- Technique #11: Delete old code that is commented out.
  - Before:
    ```python
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.custom_elements_folder:
            self._load_custom_folder(self.custom_elements_folder)
    # base_PHOTON_REGISTRIES = ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
    # PHOTON_REGISTRIES = ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
    # def __init__(self, custom_elements_folder: str = None):
    #     if custom_elements_folder:
    #         self._load_custom_folder()
    #     else:
    #         self.custom_elements = None
    #         self.custom_elements_folder = None
    #         self.custom_elements_file = None`
    ```
  - Before:
    ```python
    def __post_init__(self):
      if self.custom_elements_folder:
          self._load_custom_folder(self.custom_elements_folder)
    ```
  - Lines-of-code (LOC) complexity is reduced by elimination of commented-out old code.
  
### Coding Techniques
- Technique #12: Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel
  - Before you write a line of code for your idea or task, search for solutions that others have coded.
- Technique #13: Learn from others‚Äô code.
- Technique #14: Log; don‚Äôt print
- Technique #15: Do not code global data structures; use parameter files
- Technique #16: Create a function or method to encapsulate value checking
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def is_machine_learning_type(ml_type: str) -> bool:
      """

          Scorer.ML_TYPES))
  ```
- Technique #19: Use faulthandler
- Technique #20: Eliminate global variables ‚Äî or at least try
- Technique #21: Eliminate all unused local variables
  - Usually, your IDE identifies all dangling variables for you. If not, you use locals()and use search.
- Technique #22: Apply the Python 3.7+ @dataclass decorator before the class definition.
  - @dataclass decorates a def class definition and automatically generates the five double dunder methods: `__init__()` ,` __repr__()` , `__str__`,`__eq__()`, and `__hash__()`
  - Example:
    ```python
    @dataclass
    class PhotonRegistry:
        """
        Helper class to manage the PHOTON Element Register
        ...
        """
        custom_elements_folder: str = None
        custom_elements: str = None
        custom_elements_file: str = None
        base_PHOTON_REGISTRIES: ClassVar[List[str]] =/
       ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
        PHOTON_REGISTRIES: ClassVar[List[str]] =/
       ["PhotonCore", "PhotonNeuro"]
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.custom_elements_folder:
            self._load_custom_folder(self.custom_elements_folder)
    ```

### Testing Techniques
- Technique #24: Unit tests have 80%+ coverage. We use coverage.
- Technique #25: Integration tests must have 100% coverage of all external (API) functions, classes, class attributes, and class methods.
- Technique #26: The developers do not accomplish acceptance testing.
- Technique #27: Code type hinting checking.
- Technique #28: Test coverage
- Technique #29: Performance profiling
- Technique #29:Check security
- Technique #29:Code reliability

### Verification Techniques
- Technique #30: Code review
- Technique #31: Version control
- Technique #32: Continuous integration (CI) automation

## [I Thought I Was Mastering Python Until I Discovered These Tricks](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-thought-i-was-mastering-python-until-i-discovered-these-tricks-e40d9c71f4e2) <span id="content-7"></span>

### Introduction
- True, practice alone is not perfect, but perfect practice is.
- This means that you need to make sure that you are always following the best coding practices (commenting on your code, using correct syntax, etc.), otherwise you will likely end up adopting bad habits that could harm your future lines of code.
- A universal convention supplies all of maintainability, clarity, consistency, and a foundation for good programming habits too. What it doesn‚Äôt do is insist that you follow it against your will. That‚Äôs Python! - Tim Peters on comp.lang.python, 2001‚Äì06‚Äì16

### 1. Readability is important
- Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. Hal Abelson
- First of all, try to make your programs easy to read by following some programming conventions. A programming convention is one that a seasoned programmer follows when writing his or her code.
- There‚Äôs no quicker way to reveal that you‚Äôre a ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù than by ignoring conventions.
- Some of these conventions are specific to Python; others are used by computer programmers in all languages.
  ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*kjVAg20iyGR70YDZ3pd6qg.jpeg)
- Essentially, readability is the characteristic which specifies how easy another person can understand some parts of your code (and not you!).
- As an example, I was not used to write with vertical alignment and to align the function‚Äôs parameters with opening delimiter.
  ```python
  # No, to avoid: 
  func = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
         var_three, var_four)
  #Yes, 
  func = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                            var_three, var_four)
  ```

### 2. Avoid unuseful conditions
- Often, a long if & elif & ‚Ä¶. & else conditions is the sign of code that needs refactoring, these conditions make your code lengthy and really hard to interpret.
- Example:
  ```python
  # Bad, because we know this function return boolean
  def f():
      if condition:
          return True
      else:
          return False
  
  # Good, directly return the boolean
  def f():
      return condition
  ```
- Challenge to decide if a year is a skip year or not:
  ```python
  def is_leap(year):
      return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 != 0)
  ```

### 3. Adequate use of Whitespace
- Never mix tabs and spaces
- A line break between functions
- Two line breaks between classes
- Add a space after ‚Äú,‚Äù in dictionaries, lists, tuples, arguments in a list of arguments and after ‚Äú:‚Äù in dictionaries but not before.
- Put spaces around assignments and comparisons (except for arguments in a list)
- No space for opening / closing parentheses or just before a list of arguments.
- Example:
  ```python
  def function(key, value=0):
      """Return a dictionary and a list..."""
      d = {key: value}
      l = [key, value]
      return d, l
  ```

### 4. Docstrings and Comments
- Docstrings = How to use the code
- Comments = Why (rational) and how the code works
- Explain the purpose of a function even if it seems obvious to you because it will not necessarily seem obvious to another person later.
- Describe the expected parameters, the returned values and the exceptions raised.
- If the method is strongly coupled to a single caller, mention the calling function.
- The comments explain what are for the maintainers of your code. Examples including notes for yourself, such as:
  ```python
  # !!! BUG: ‚Ä¶
  # !!! FIX: This is a hack
  # ??? Why is this here?
  ```
- It is on your responsibility to write good docstrings and good comments, so always keep them up to date! When making changes, make sure the comments and docstrings are consistent with the code.

### 5. Variables and Assignment
- Comparing to other programming languages:
  ```python
  # Others
  c = a
  a = b
  b = c
  
  # Python
  b, a = a, b
  ```
- A tuple is created on the right (tuple packing).
- A tuple is the target on the left (tuple unpacking).
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> user =['Jan', 'Gomez', '+1-888-222-1546']
  >>> name, title, phone = user
  >>> name
  'Jan'
  >>> title
  'Gomez'
  >>> phone
  '+1-888-222-1546'
  
  >>> jan, (gname, gtitle, gphone) = people
  >>> gname
  'German'
  >>> gtitle
  'GBT'
  >>> gphone
  'unlisted'
  >>> jan
  ['Jan', 'Gomez', '+1-888-222-1546']
  ```

### 6. List Concatenation & Join
- How to concatenate in a better way:
  ```python
  # Dont
  result = ''
  for s in colors:
      result += s
  
  # Do
  result = ''.join(colors)
  ```

### 7. Test true conditions
- Example:
  ```python
  # Do this :     # And not this :
  if x:             if x == True:
     pass                  pass
  # Do this :     # And not this :
  if items:         if len(items) != 0:
      pass                pass
  # and especially not that :
          if items != []:
                 pass
  ```

### 8. Use enumerate when it‚Äôs possible
- The enumerate function takes a list and returns pairs (index, item):
  ```python
  items = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three']
  >>> print list(enumerate(items))
  [(0, 'zero'), (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]
  ```
- Print does not take one result at a time but must be in possession of the entire message to be displayed. We therefore automatically converted the generator to a list before using print.
- Wny enumerate is better:
  ```python
  for (index, item) in enumerate(items):
      print (index, item)
  # compared to :              # And :
  index = 0                     for i in range(len(items)):
  for item in items:                    print (i, items[i])
      print (index, item)
      index += 1
  ```

### 9. List Comprehension
- Example:
  ```python
  # without list comprehension
  new_list = []
  for item in a_list:
      if condition(item):
          new_list.append(fn(item))
  
  # With list comprehension
  new_list = [fn(item) for item in a_list if condition(item)]
  ```

### 10. Generator Expressions
- The better way to use sum function:
  ```python
  # With a list comprehension :
  total = sum([num * num for num in range(1, 101)])
  # With a generator expression :
  total = sum(num * num for num in xrange(1, 101))
  ```
- The generator expressions are like list comprehensions, except in their calculation, they are lazy.
- Listcomps calculate the entire result in a single pass, to store it in a list.
- Generator expressions calculate one value at a time, when necessary.
- This is particularly useful when the sequence is very long and the generated list is only an intermediate step and not the final result.
- The difference in syntax is that listcomps have square brackets, while generator expressions do not. Generator expressions sometimes require parentheses, so you should always use them.
- Use a list comprehension when the expected result is the list.
- Use a generator expression when the list is only an intermediate result.

## [An A-Z of useful Python tricks](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/an-a-z-of-useful-python-tricks-b467524ee747) <span id="content-8"></span>

### all or any
- Example:
  ```python
  x = [True, True, False]
  if any(x):
      print("At least one True")
  if all(x):
      print("Not one False")
  if any(x) and not all(x):
      print("At least one True and one False")
  ```

### collections
- Example:
  ```python
  from collections import OrderedDict, Counter
  # Remembers the order the keys are added!
  x = OrderedDict(a=1, b=2, c=3)
  # Counts the frequency of each character
  y = Counter("Hello World!")
  ```
  
### dir
- Example:
  ```python
  >>> dir()
  >>> dir("Hello World")
  >>> dir(dir)
  ```

### from `__future__` import
- The `__future__` module lets you import functionality from future versions of Python. It‚Äôs literally like time travel, or magic, or something.
- Example:
```python
from __future__ import print_function
print("Hello World!")
```

### geopy
- It works by abstracting the APIs of a range of different geocoding services. It enables you to obtain a place‚Äôs full street address, latitude, longitude, and even altitude.
- Example:
  ```python
  from geopy import GoogleV3
  place = "221b Baker Street, London"
  location = GoogleV3().geocode(place)
  print(location.address)
  print(location.location)
  ```

### Operator overloading
- It‚Äôs actually a simple concept. Ever wondered why Python lets you use the + operator to add numbers and also to concatenate strings? That‚Äôs operator overloading in action.
- Example:
  ```python
  class Thing:
      def __init__(self, value):
          self.__value = value
      def __gt__(self, other):
          return self.__value > other.__value
      def __lt__(self, other):
          return self.__value < other.__value
  something = Thing(100)
  nothing = Thing(0)
  # True
  something > nothing
  # False
  something < nothing
  # Error
  something + nothing
  ```

### `__repr__`
- When defining a class or an object in Python, it is useful to provide an ‚Äòofficial‚Äô way of representing that object as a string.
- Example:
  ```python
  class someClass:
      def __repr__(self):
          return "<some description here>"
  someInstance = someClass()
  # prints <some description here>
  print(someInstance)
  ```
  
### sh
- Example:
  ```python
  import sh
  sh.pwd()
  sh.mkdir('new_folder')
  sh.touch('new_file.txt')
  sh.whoami()
  sh.echo('This is great!')
  ```
  
### Type hints
- Example:
  ```python
  from typing import List
  Vector = List[float]
  Matrix = List[Vector]
  def addMatrix(a : Matrix, b : Matrix) -> Matrix:
    result = []
    for i,row in enumerate(a):
      result_row =[]
      for j, col in enumerate(row):
        result_row += [a[i][j] + b[i][j]]
      result += [result_row]
    return result
  x = [[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]]
  y = [[2.0, 1.0], [0.0, -2.0]]
  z = addMatrix(x, y)
  ```

### uuid
- Example:
  ```python
  import uuid
  user_id = uuid.uuid4()
  print(user_id)
  ```
